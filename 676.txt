'''Andrei Arsenyevich Tarkovsky''' ({{lang-rus|Андре́й Арсе́ньевич Тарко́вский|p=ɐnˈdrʲej ɐrˈsʲenʲjɪvʲɪtɕ tɐrˈkofskʲɪj}}; 4 April 1932 – 29 December 1986) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russians|Russian]] film-maker, writer, film editor, [[film theory|film theorist]], theatre and opera director.

Tarkovsky's films include ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'', ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'', ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', and ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]''. He directed the first five of his seven feature films in the [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]]; his last two films, ''[[Nostalghia]]'' and ''[[The Sacrifice]]'', were produced in [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and [[Cinema of Sweden|Sweden]], respectively. His work is characterized by spiritual and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, long takes, lack of conventional [[dramatic structure]], and distinctively authored use of cinematography. His contribution was so influential that works done in a similar way are described as '''Tarkovskian'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hampton|first1=Howard|title=Riffs: 'On Celestial Music,' by Rick Moody|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/books/review/on-celestial-music-by-rick-moody.html|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robey|first1=Tim|title=How I Ended This Summer, review|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/8467251/How-I-Ended-This-Summer-review.html|accessdate=20 April 2015|work=tf|date=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is widely regarded as one of the greatest film-makers of all time.

[[Ingmar Bergman]] said of Tarkovsky:

::&quot;Tarkovsky for me is the greatest (director), the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Title quote of 2003 Tarkovsky Festival Program, Pacific Film Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Childhood and early life===
Tarkovsky was born in the village of Zavrazhye in the [[Yuryevetsky District]] of the [[Ivanovo Industrial Oblast]] to poet and translator [[Arseny Tarkovsky|Arseny Alexandrovich Tarkovsky]], native of [[Yelisavetgrad|Kirovohrad]], [[Ukraine]]; and Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova, a graduate of the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]]. Andrei's grandfather Aleksander Tarkowski was a [[Poles|Polish]] nobleman who worked as a bank clerk.

Tarkovsky spent his childhood in [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast|Yuryevets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marina |last=Sipatova |script-title=ru:Тайна рода Тарковских |work=[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]] |year=2007 |url=http://www.mk.ru/blogs/MK/2007/02/20/culture/92002 |language=Russian|accessdate=25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was described by childhood friends as active and popular, having many friends and being typically in the center of action. In 1937, his father left the family, subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941. Tarkovsky stayed with his mother, moving with her and his sister Marina to Moscow, where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press. In 1939, Tarkovsky enrolled at the Moscow School № 554. During the war, the three evacuated to [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast|Yuryevets]], living with his maternal grandmother. In 1943, the family returned to Moscow. Tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school, where the poet [[Andrey Voznesensky]] was one of his class-mates. He studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school. The family lived on Shchipok Street in the [[Zamoskvorechye District]] in Moscow. From November 1947 to Spring 1948 he was in the hospital with [[tuberculosis]]. Many themes of his childhood – the evacuation, his mother and her two children, the withdrawn father, the time in the hospital – feature prominently in his film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]''.

Following high school graduation, from 1951 to 1952, Tarkovsky studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at the Oriental Institute in Moscow, a branch of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]]. Although he already spoke some Arabic and was a successful student in his first semesters, he did not finish his studies and dropped out to work as a prospector for the Academy of Science Institute for Non-Ferrous Metals and Gold. He participated in a year-long research expedition to the river Kureikye near [[Turukhansk]] in the [[Krasnoyarsk Krai|Krasnoyarsk Province]]. During this time in the [[Taiga]] Tarkovsky decided to study film.

===Film school student===
Upon returning from the research expedition in 1954, Tarkovsky applied at the [[All-Union State Institute of Cinematography|State Institute of Cinematography]] (VGIK) and was admitted to the film directing program. He was in the same class as [[Irma Raush]] whom he married in April 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;kompravda&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Anastasia | last=Pleshakova |title= Тарковский был &quot;разрешенным контрреволюционером&quot; |trans_title= Tarkovsky was &quot;a legal сounterrevolutionary&quot;| publisher= [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] |date=4 April 2007 |url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/23881/65502/ |accessdate=27 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080104174327/http://www.kp.ru/daily/23881/65502/| archivedate= 4 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] era offered unique opportunities for young film directors. Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The [[Khrushchev Thaw]] relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealists]], [[French New Wave]], and of directors such as [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], [[Luis Buñuel|Buñuel]], [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[Robert Bresson|Bresson]], [[Andrzej Wajda]] (whose film ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' influenced Tarkovsky) and [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]]. Tarkovsky absorbed the idea of the [[auteur theory|auteur]] as a necessary condition for creativity{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

Tarkovsky's teacher and mentor was [[Mikhail Romm]], who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors. In 1956, Tarkovsky directed his first student short film, ''[[The Killers (1956 film)|The Killers]]'', from a short story of [[Ernest Hemingway]]. The short film ''[[There Will Be No Leave Today]]'' and the screenplay ''[[Concentrate (screenplay)|Concentrate]]'' followed in 1958 and 1959.

An important influence on Tarkovsky was the film director [[Grigori Chukhrai]], who was teaching at the V.G.I.K. Impressed by the talent of his student, Chukhrai offered Tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film ''Clear Skies''. Tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;kompravda&quot; /&gt;

During his third year at the V.G.I.K., Tarkovsky met [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. They found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films. In 1959, they wrote the script ''Antarctica – Distant Country'', which was later published in the ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]''. Tarkovsky submitted the script to [[Lenfilm]], but it was rejected. They were more successful with the script ''[[The Steamroller and the Violin]]'', which they sold to [[Mosfilm]]. This became Tarkovsky's graduation project, earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning First Prize at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961.

==Career==

===Film career in the Soviet Union===
Tarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He had inherited the film from director Eduard Abalov, who had to abort the project. The film earned Tarkovsky international acclaim and won the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1962. In the same year, on 30 September, his first son Arseny (called Senka in Tarkovsky's diaries) Tarkovsky was born.
[[File:Tarkovsky vgik.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Monument to Andrei Tarkovsky at entrance of [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]]]]
In 1965, he directed the film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' about the life of [[Andrei Rublev]], the fifteenth-century Russian [[iconography|icon painter]]. ''Andrei Rublev'' was not, except for a single screening in Moscow in 1966, immediately released after completion due to problems with Soviet authorities. Tarkovsky had to cut the film several times, resulting in several different versions of varying lengths. A version of the film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1969 and won the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]]. The film was widely released in the Soviet Union in a cut version in 1971.

He divorced his wife, [[Irma Raush]], in June 1970. In the same year, he married [[Larisa Tarkovskaya|Larissa Kizilova]] (née Egorkina), who had been a production assistant for the film ''Andrei Rublev'' (they had been living together since 1965). Their son, Andrei Andreyevich Tarkovsky, was born in the same year on 7 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Gianvito | first=John | title=Andrei Tarkovsky: Interviews ([[Conversations with Filmmakers Series]]) | year=2006 | publisher=University Press of Mississippi | location= | isbn=1-57806-220-9 | pages=XXV}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, he completed ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', an adaptation of the novel ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'' by [[Stanisław Lem]]. He had worked on this together with screen-writer Fridrikh Gorenshtein as early as 1968. The film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Spécial du Jury]] and the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]], and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]. From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems. Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles ''Confession'', ''White day'' and ''A white, white day''. From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Russian authorities placed the film in the &quot;third category,&quot; a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns. Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Herbert. ''Sight and Sound''. Vol 45, no 2. Spring 1976. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties are presumed to have made Tarkovsky play with the idea of going abroad and producing a film outside the Soviet film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During 1975, Tarkovsky also worked on the screenplay ''[[Hoffmanniana]]'', about the German writer and poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]. In December 1976, he directed ''[[Hamlet]]'', his only stage play, at the [[Lenkom Theatre]] in Moscow. The main role was played by [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]], who also acted in several of Tarkovsky's films. At the end of 1978, he also wrote the screenplay ''Sardor'' together with the writer Aleksandr Misharin.

The last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by the brothers [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]. Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986. Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel ''[[Dead Mountaineer's Hotel]]'' and he developed a raw script. Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on ''Roadside Picnic''. Work on this film began in 1976. The production was mired in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots. Tarkovsky's relationship with cinematographer [[Georgy Rerberg]] deteriorated to the point where he hired [[Alexander Knyazhinsky]] as a new first cinematographer. Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay. The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

In the same year Tarkovsky also began the production of the film ''The First Day'' (Russian: Первый День ''Pervyj Dyen′''), based on a script by his friend and long-term collaborator [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. The film was set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and starred [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] and [[Anatoli Papanov]]. To get the project approved by [[Goskino]], Tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script, omitting several scenes that were critical of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|official atheism in the Soviet Union]]. After shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by Goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors. Tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Film career outside the Soviet Union===
During the summer of 1979, Tarkovsky traveled to Italy, where he shot the documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' together with his long-time friend [[Tonino Guerra]]. Tarkovsky returned to Italy in 1980 for an extended trip during which he and Guerra completed the script for the film ''[[Nostalghia]]''.

Tarkovsky returned to Italy in 1982 to start shooting ''[[Nostalghia]]''. He did not return to his home country. As [[Mosfilm]] withdrew from the project, he had to complete the film with financial support provided by the Italian [[RAI]]. Tarkovsky completed the film in 1983. ''[[Nostalghia]]'' was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and won the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]] and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. Tarkovsky also shared a special prize called ''Grand Prix du cinéma de creation'' with [[Robert Bresson]]. Soviet authorities prevented the film from winning the [[Palme d'Or]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagstaff2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book

He spent most of 1984 preparing the film ''[[The Sacrifice]]''. At a press conference in [[Milan]] on 10 July 1984, he announced that he would never return to the Soviet Union and would remain in Europe. At that time, his son Andrei Jr. was still in the Soviet Union and not allowed to leave the country.

During 1985, he shot the film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' in Sweden. At the end of the year he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. In January 1986, he began treatment in Paris and was joined there by his son, who was finally allowed to leave the Soviet Union. ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and received the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Spécial du Jury]], the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]] and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. As Tarkovsky was unable to attend due to his illness, the prizes were collected by his son, Andrei Jr.
[[Image:Gravestone of Andrei Tarkovsky 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Andrei and Larisa Tarkovsky's grave, [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]] in France]]
In Tarkovsky's last [[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970-1986|diary]] entry (15 December 1986), he wrote: &quot;But now I have no strength left – that is the problem&quot;. The diaries are sometimes also known as ''[[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970-1986|Martyrolog]]'' and were published posthumously in 1989 and in English in 1991.

Tarkovsky died in Paris on 29 December 1986. His funeral ceremony was held at the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Paris|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]]. He was buried on 3 January 1987 in the [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery|Russian Cemetery]] in [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Essonne|Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois]] in France. The inscription on his gravestone, which was created by the Russian sculptor [[Ernst Neizvestny]], reads: ''To the man who saw the Angel''.

A controversy emerged in Russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that Tarkovsky did not die of natural causes but was assassinated by the [[KGB]]. Evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former KGB agents who claim that [[Viktor Chebrikov]] gave the order to eradicate Tarkovsky to curtail what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as [[anti-Soviet propaganda]] by Tarkovsky. Other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 coup]] and the claim by one of Tarkovsky's doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause.&lt;ref&gt;Komsolmoskaya Pravda, &quot;New Tarkovsky documents surface&quot;, 15. September 1995, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tarkovsky, his wife [[Larisa Tarkovskaya]] and actor [[Anatoli Solonitsyn]] all died from the very same type of lung cancer, Vladimir Sharun, sound designer in ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', is convinced that they were all poisoned when shooting the film near a chemical plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tyrkin |first=Stas |title=In Stalker Tarkovsky foretold Chernobyl |journal=Komsomolskaya Pravda |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Stalker/sharun.html |date=23 March 2001 |accessdate=9 September 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091009192507/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Stalker/sharun.html| archivedate= 9 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filmography===
{{main|Andrei Tarkovsky filmography}}
Tarkovsky is mainly known as a film director. During his career he directed only seven feature films, as well as three shorts from his time at V.G.I.K. He also wrote several screenplays. He furthermore directed the play ''[[Hamlet]]'' for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' in London, and he directed a radio production of the short story ''Turnabout'' by [[William Faulkner]]. He also wrote ''[[Sculpting in Time]]'', a book on film theory.

Tarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He then directed ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' in 1966, ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' in 1972, ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' in 1979. The documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' was produced in Italy in 1982, as was ''[[Nostalghia]]'' in 1983. His last film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter. Tarkovsky once said that a director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and monotonous films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |title=Lectures on Film Directing (notes from classes taught by Tarkovsky at the State Institute of Cinematography) |journal=Iskusstvo Kino |year=1990 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Illg |first=Jerzy |title=Z Andriejem Tarkowskim rozmawiają Jerzy Illg, Leonard Neuger |journal=Res Publica |volume=1 |pages=137–160 |location=Warsaw |year=1987 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book of 60 photos, ''Instant Light, Tarkovsky Polaroids'', taken by Tarkovsky in Russia and Italy between 1979 and 1984 was published in 2006. The collection was selected by Italian photographer Giovanni Chiaramonte and Tarkovsky's son Andrey A Tarkovsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Instant Light, Tarkovsky Polaroids|last = Tarkovsky|first = Andrei|publisher = Thames and Hudson|year = 2006|isbn = 9780500286142|location = |pages = |editor-last = Chiaramonte|editor-first = Giovanni|editor2-last = Tarkovsky|editor2-first = Andrey A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
{{main|List of awards won by Andrei Tarkovsky}}
Numerous awards were bestowed on Tarkovsky throughout his lifetime. At the [[Venice Film Festival]] he was awarded the [[Golden Lion]] for ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]''. At the [[Cannes Film Festival]], he won the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]] four times, the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] three times (more than any other director), and the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Spécial du Jury]] twice. He was also nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] two times. In 1987, the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] awarded the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film#1980s|BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] to ''[[The Sacrifice]]''.
[[Image:Andrei tarkovsky stamp russia 2007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Russian stamp featuring Tarkovsky]]
Under the influence of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], Tarkovsky was finally recognized in the Soviet Union in the Autumn of 1986, shortly before his death, by a retrospective of his films in Moscow. After his death, an entire issue of the film magazine ''Iskusstvo Kino'' was devoted to Tarkovsky. In their obituaries, the film committee of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]] and the Union of Soviet Film Makers expressed their sorrow that Tarkovsky had to spend the last years of his life in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary |publisher=[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]] |date=7 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posthumously, he was awarded the [[Lenin Prize]] in 1990, one of the highest state honors in the Soviet Union. In 1989 the ''Andrei Tarkovsky Memorial Prize'' was established, with its first recipient being the Russian animator [[Yuriy Norshteyn]]. Since 1993, the [[Moscow International Film Festival]] awards the annual ''Andrei Tarkovsky Award''. In 1996 the Andrei Tarkovsky Museum opened in [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast|Yuryevets]], his childhood town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=МУЗЕЙ А.ТАРКОВСКОГО |url=http://www.museum.ru/tarkovsky |accessdate=30 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[minor planet]], [[3345 Tarkovskij]], discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina]] in 1982, has also been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmadel |first=Lutz |title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |url=http://books.google.com/books?q=3345+tarkovskij |isbn=3-540-00238-3 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarkovsky has been the subject of several documentaries. Most notable is the 1988 documentary ''[[Moscow Elegy]]'', by Russian film director [[Alexander Sokurov]]. Sokurov's own work has been heavily influenced by Tarkovsky. The film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from Tarkovsky's films. ''Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky'' is 1988 documentary film by [[Michal Leszczylowski]], an editor of the film ''The Sacrifice''. Film director [[Chris Marker]] produced the television documentary ''[[One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich]]'' as an homage to Andrei Tarkovsky in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Significant Documentaries |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheDocumentaries/Documentaries.html |accessdate=15 January 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080115220027/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheDocumentaries/Documentaries.html| archivedate= 15 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ingmar Bergman]] was quoted as saying: &quot;Tarkovsky for me is the greatest [of us all], the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Film historian [[Steven Dillon (writer and professor)|Steven Dillon]] claims that much of subsequent film was deeply influenced by the films of Tarkovsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dillon|first=Steven|title=The Solaris Effect: Art and Artifice in Contemporary American Film|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-292-71345-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the entrance to the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]] in [[Moscow, Russia]] there is a monument that includes statues of Tarkovsky, [[Gennady Shpalikov]] and [[Vasily Shukshin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panoramio.com/photo/26383277 Panoramio – Photo of Monument to Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography famous learner – Gennady Shpalikov, Andrei Tarkovsky and Vasily Shukshin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Background====

Although some authors claim that the screenplay was filmed, according to Marina Tarkovskaya, Tarkovsky's sister (and wife of Aleksandr Gordon, a fellow student of Tarvosky during his film school years) the screenplay was never filmed. Tarkovsky wrote the screenplay during his entrance examination at the [[All-Union State Institute of Cinematography|State Institute of Cinematography]] (VGIK) in a single sitting. He earned the highest possible grade, excellent ({{lang-ru|отлично}}) for this work. In 1994 fragments of the ''Concentrate'' were filmed and used in the documentary ''Andrei Tarkovsky's Taiga Summer'' by Marina Tarkovskaya and Aleksandr Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Influences==
Tarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s, a period referred to as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], during which Soviet society opened to foreign films, literature and music, among other things. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of European, American and Japanese directors, an experience which influenced his own film making. His teacher and mentor at the film school, [[Mikhail Romm]], allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director.

Tarkovsky was, according to Shavkat Abdusalmov, a fellow student at the film school, fascinated by Japanese films. He was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a Samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abdusalamov |first=Shavkat |author2=translated by Sergei Sossinsky |title=Feedback Effects, in About Andrei Tarkovsky, Memoirs and Biographies |publisher=Progress Publishers |year=1990 |location=Moscow |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Japanese_Influences.html |isbn=5-01-001973-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of Haiku and its ability to create &quot;images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tarkovsky, Andrei. Sculpting in Time. Trans. Kitty Hunter-Blair. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Tarkovsky told film historian [[Leonid Kozlov]] his ten favorite films. The list includes: ''[[Diary of a Country Priest]]'' and ''[[Mouchette]]'', by [[Robert Bresson]]; ''[[Winter Light]]'', ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'' and ''[[Persona (film)|Persona]]'', by [[Ingmar Bergman]]; ''[[Nazarín]]'', by [[Luis Buñuel]]; ''[[City Lights]]'', by [[Charlie Chaplin]]; ''[[Ugetsu]]'', by [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]; ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', by [[Akira Kurosawa]], and ''[[Woman in the Dunes]]'', by [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]]. Among his favorite directors were Buñuel, Mizoguchi, Bergman, Bresson, Kurosawa, [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Jean Vigo]], and [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lasica |first=Tom |title=Tarkovsky's Choice |journal=Sight and Sound |volume=3 |issue=3 |date=March 1993 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Tarkovsky-TopTen.html |accessdate=25 December 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071121082212/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Tarkovsky-TopTen.html| archivedate= 21 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of ''City Lights'', the list does not contain any films of the early silent era. The reason is that Tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon, with the early film-making forming only a prelude. The list has also no films or directors from Tarkovsky's native Russia, although he rated Soviet directors such as [[Boris Barnet]], [[Sergei Paradjanov]] and [[Alexander Dovzhenko]] highly.

Although strongly opposed to commercial cinema, in a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film ''[[The Terminator]]'', saying its &quot;vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art&quot;. He was critical of the &quot;brutality and low acting skills&quot;, but nevertheless impressed by this film.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt;

==Cinematic style==
Tarkovsky's films are characterized by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, extremely [[long take]]s, and memorable images of exceptional beauty. Recurring motifs are dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera. He once said, “Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away, relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema.”

Tarkovsky included levitation scenes into several of his films, most notably ''Solaris''. To him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=de Brantes |first=Charles |title=La foi est la seule chose qui puisse sauver l'homme |newspaper=La France Catholique |date=20 June 1986 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_On.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water, clouds, and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value, as well as their symbolism, such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=English Programme Booklet for ''The Sacrifice'' |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_For_Dummies.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bells and candles are also frequent symbols. These are symbols of film, sight and sound, and Tarkovsky's film frequently has themes of self-reflection.

Tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called &quot;sculpting in time&quot;. By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it. Unedited movie footage transcribes time in [[Real-time (media)|real time]]. By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another.

Up to, and including, his film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory. After ''Mirror'', he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the [[dramatic unities]] proposed by [[Aristotle]]: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day.

Several of Tarkovsky's films have color or black and white sequences. This first occurs in the otherwise monochrome ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'', which features a color epilogue of [[Andrei Rublev|Rublev's]] authentic religious icon paintings. All of his films afterwards contain monochrome, and in ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker's]]'' case [[Sepia tone|sepia]] sequences, while otherwise being in color. In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing ''Andrei Rublev'', Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a &quot;commercial gimmick&quot; and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color. He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time, and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time, as this distracts the viewer. To him, films in color were like moving paintings or photographs, which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chugunova |first=Maria |title=On Cinema – Interview with Tarkovsky |journal=To the Screen |date=December 1966 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vadim Yusov===
Tarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer [[Vadim Yusov]] from 1958 to 1972, and much of the visual style of Tarkovsky's films can be attributed to this collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;List of Noted Film Director And Cinematographer Collaborations: Andrei Tarkovsky Vadim Yusov, Museum of Learning. [http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/List_of_noted_film_director_and_cinematographer_collaborations::sub::Andrei_Tarkovsky_Vadim_Yusov]&lt;/ref&gt; Tarkovsky would spend two days preparing for Yusov to film a single long take, and due to the preparation, usually only a single take was needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrei Tarkovsky p. 79&quot;&gt;The films of Andrei Tarkovsky: a visual fugue By Vida T. Johnson, Graham Petrie, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sven Nykvist===
In his last film, ''[[The Sacrifice]]'', Tarkovsky worked with cinematographer [[Sven Nykvist]], who had worked closely with director [[Ingmar Bergman]] on many of Ingmar Bergman's films – multiple people who worked with Bergman worked on the production, notably lead actor [[Erland Josephson]], who had acted for Tarkovsky in ''[[Nostalghia]]''. Nykvist complained that Tarkovsky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrei Tarkovsky p. 79&quot;/&gt;
